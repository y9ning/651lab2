Intro:
The application is based on the leaflet.js and GeoJSON date features extracted
from the open Calgary api url link. Index1.html is the main application page,
which is supported by a map.js file and a request.js file. When search for the date
range, it is important to follow stynax that the placeholder suggest (there are spaces
before and after the "-" sign dividing the range end A and range end B.)
